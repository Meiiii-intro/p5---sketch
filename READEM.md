# Merry Christmas

## Short Description
To celebrate Christmas Day, to use p5js to make some interesting things.

##Concept
This work imagines the “three trees” as three clusters of energy bodies composed of stardust-like particles. They are not fixed forms but rather a kind of temporarily maintained order by the system: thousands of tiny particles gather to outline the shape of trees on the screen, gently flickering and drifting like breathing, suggesting that the structure is inherently unstable.

The audience enters the work through a camera. Hand tracking detects the distance between the thumb and index finger; when they pinch together, the work interprets this gesture as a moment of “energy release.” Particles burst outward from the center of each tree with a swirling rotational bias, creating a brief moment of disorder and expansion: the tree forms are scattered, the established order collapses, and energy overflows. When the pinch is released, the system activates a “return mechanism,” gradually pulling particles back to their original target positions, slowly reconstructing the tree structures and restoring a seemingly stable state.

The color system further emphasizes internal divisions and emotional qualities within the structure: the treetops glow in golden tones like radiant energy crowns; the left side of each tree leans toward green-cyan hues, the right side toward purple-blue, and the center toward red-orange, with occasional white sparkles appearing like random “highlight events.” Using additive blending (ADD) and semi-transparent background layering, the visuals create trailing afterimages and luminous halos reminiscent of a night sky, making the particles feel more like flowing energy than physical matter.

Ultimately, the work explores a cycle of stability — trigger — collapse — reconstruction. A tiny gesture can disrupt a vast structure, yet the system automatically restores itself once the hand is released. Through this interaction, the audience experiences that while we may feel we are “in control,” we are often only temporarily perturbing a system — which will always find its own way back to order.
